# Bookworm

An online book review application made with the MERN tech stack.

## Tech Stack, Dependencies

We utilize the MERN Tech Stack, and version 5 of the [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) programming language for type safety.

This project utilizes several other libraries and dependencies. See the `package.json` in each of the `backend` and `frontend` directories for more information on additional dependency versions.

In the `frontend` and `backend` directories, run `npm i` to install all dependencies needed for the project.

## Getting Started

### Contributing

1) Clone the repository
2) For both the `backend` and `frontend` directories, navigate to each of these directories and run `npm i` to install dependencies
3) Create a new branch for your changes (ex: `feat/new-button`, `fix/refresh-bug`, `chore/cleanup`)
4) Use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
5) Open a pull request to suggest your changes

### Project Structure

This repository contains two root directories: `frontend`, and `backend`:

- The `frontend` directory contains all source files relating to the *frontend* of the application, including the client
- The `backend` directory contains all source files relating to the *backend* of the application, including the database and API

Each of these root directories are their own node.js package, and have different steps for testing and deployment. See the README's of each for more information.

Each of these directories may also contain the following additional sub-directories:

- `node_modules` contains the dependencies for said portion of the project. This folder is included in the project's gitignore, and should not be committed to source control
- `dist` contains compiled source files ready to be deployed to production

### Starting the project

See the README's in the `frontend` and `backend` directories for more information on starting each of these.
