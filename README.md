1. Edit backend/index.js file's MongoDB credential, replace it to your own MongoDB credential. I made some comments in the index.js file, you can easily find it.

2. Run **npm i** under both frontend/ and backend/ folder.

3. Make sure you have installed Node.js and you can use npm command. Open a terminal or powershell windows, switch to signup/frontend/ directory, run **npm start**.

4. Open another terminal or powershell windows, switch to signup/backend/ directory, run **npm start**.
